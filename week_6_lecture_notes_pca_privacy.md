# SVD + privacy (6 chapters)

Excellent — let’s jump into **Teachify Chapter 1** with our **privacy-preserving glasses on** 😎🔍

🧠 Chapter 1: Revisiting PCA — Geometric & Algebraic Intuition (Privacy-First View)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

### 🎯 What’s PCA again?

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a foundational method in data science that:

*   **Rotates** your dataset into a new coordinate system.
*   Orders those axes (called **principal components**) by how much **variance** (aka _information_) they capture.
*   Optionally **discards** the axes with low variance (which often encode noise or redundancy).

This sounds purely mathematical. But from a **privacy** point of view, there's a huge red flag here:

> PCA **learns its rotation** by analyzing _correlations across all data points_.

So it's not just compressing your data — it's _mining structure from private information_.

* * *

### 🧭 Geometrically, What’s Going On?

Imagine your dataset as a **cloud of dots** in 3D space. Say it’s user profiles: income, number of logins, device type.

*   PCA fits a new set of **orthogonal axes** to this cloud.
*   The **first axis (PC1)** points in the direction of **maximum spread** (i.e., strongest correlation pattern).
*   The **second axis (PC2)** is orthogonal to PC1 and captures the next most variation, and so on.

➡️ These new axes are **linear combinations** of the original dimensions — and these combinations **reveal patterns in your data**.

💥 **Privacy concern**:  
If your data has strong patterns (say, income vs. device usage), PCA _will expose_ these by aligning the principal components with them.

* * *

### 🧮 Algebraic Core: Covariance & Eigenvalues

Now let’s ground this geometrically pretty idea in some linear algebra.

PCA starts with the **covariance matrix**:

$$
\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} X^T X
$$

Where:

*    $X$  is the centered data matrix (mean-subtracted),
*    $\Sigma$  captures **pairwise correlations** between dimensions.

Then, we compute the **eigenvalues and eigenvectors** of  $\Sigma$ . These:

*   Reveal the **directions** of maximum variance (eigenvectors),
*   Tell us **how much variance** is along each direction (eigenvalues).

And then:

$$
X = U \Lambda V^T
$$

Which is the **Singular Value Decomposition** (SVD) — it encodes both **rotation** and **spread** in one beautiful package.

* * *

### 🛡️ What Happens to Privacy Here?

Let’s put on the privacy lens:

#### 1\. **You need the entire dataset to compute  $\Sigma$ **

➡️ So every individual contributes to the global structure.

#### 2\. **The rotation matrix  $V$  is global**

➡️ If someone knows your rotation matrix, they can **undo your anonymization**.

#### 3\. **Eigenvectors reveal “sensitive directions”**

➡️ Say you have a hidden cluster (e.g., based on political views). PCA might **rotate one axis directly onto that group**, making it easy to identify.

* * *

### 🧪 Example: Gender Correlation

Imagine you have a dataset of users with income, app activity, and inferred gender. Even if you remove the “gender” column, PCA might find a strong component aligned with **other attributes correlated to gender**, effectively **reconstructing sensitive info**.

This shows that:

> PCA is **not neutral** — it actively **learns correlations**, which might be private.

* * *

### 🚨 Summary of Privacy Pitfalls in Vanilla PCA:

| Step | Action | Privacy Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Centering | Use means over data | Leaks average behavior |
| Covariance | Measures pairwise structure | Leaks cross-attribute patterns |
| Eigenvectors | Encode correlations | Can align with sensitive features |
| Projection | Reduces noise | But also amplifies certain patterns |

* * *

✅ Closing Thoughts for Chapter 1
--------------------------------

PCA is a **powerful lens** to look at your data — but it’s also a **magnifying glass for patterns**, even those you didn’t intend to reveal.

So in privacy-sensitive contexts (e.g., health, demographics, behavior logs), _naively applying PCA is dangerous_. You might be amplifying the very signals you're trying to protect.

Up next in Chapter 2, we’ll explore **why even mathematically perfect rotations leak sensitive information** and how that motivates _privacy-aware_ PCA variants.

Let me know when you’re ready!

## Response:
Absolutely, let’s now dive into **Teachify Chapter 2: Motivation for Privacy in PCA** — where we zoom in on _how_ and _why_ plain PCA can be a threat to privacy, and introduce a foundational concept in differential privacy: **sensitivity**.

* * *

🧠 Chapter 2: Motivation for Privacy in PCA
-------------------------------------------

* * *

### 🧨 Why Plain PCA Leaks Sensitive Info

Let’s imagine you're analyzing user behavior data. You run PCA to reduce dimensionality for visualization or speed — and then publish either:

*   the **transformed dataset**, or
*   the **principal components themselves** (e.g. eigenvectors of the covariance matrix).

💥 Here’s the problem:

> **PCA is trained _on_ your private data.**  
> The learned rotation (the PCA basis) **contains global statistical patterns** that directly reflect sensitive correlations in the dataset.

Let’s be precise.

* * *

#### 🔍 Example:

Suppose your dataset includes:

*   Gender (not explicitly, but indirectly through correlated features like device usage or purchase patterns),
*   Income,
*   Activity.

PCA may:

*   Create a principal component **aligned with the "gender" direction**.
*   Retain that axis in the reduced data.
*   Let an adversary **reconstruct gender indirectly**, even if you removed the column.

This is what we mean when we say:

> PCA doesn’t just compress — it **extracts and exposes** hidden correlations.

* * *

### 🧭 Eigenvector Alignment and the Privacy Problem

Let’s take a step back.

When we compute the **covariance matrix  $\Sigma$ ** of the dataset and do eigen-decomposition:

$$
\Sigma = V \Lambda V^T
$$
*   The **columns of  $V$ ** are eigenvectors = the directions of variation (principal axes),
*   The **diagonal of  $\Lambda$ ** tells us how strong that variation is.

Here’s the core insight:

> The **top eigenvectors align with the most dominant correlation structures** in your data — and these may be private.

So if an attacker knows the PCA axes, they know:

*   What your dataset's main variations are.
*   Which combinations of features strongly correlate.

➡️ **Even without raw data**, **publishing eigenvectors leaks structure**.

* * *

### 📏 Introducing Sensitivity

Let’s now turn to a central idea in **differential privacy**:

### 🔹 **Global Sensitivity**

It measures how much a function’s **output can change** if **just one input record is changed**.

**In symbols:**  
If  $f$  is a function on a dataset, then:

$$
\Delta f = \max_{D, D'} \| f(D) - f(D') \|
$$

where  $D$  and  $D'$  differ by only **one row** (i.e., one person’s data).

* * *

### 🛑 Problem for PCA:

PCA has **high sensitivity** — especially when:

*   Your dataset is **small**,
*   And one person’s data is **outlying**.

In such cases:

*   **One individual can significantly change** the orientation of an eigenvector,
*   Causing **large shifts** in the PCA axes or projection results.

🚨 That’s risky — it means:

> Someone’s **presence** in the data can be _inferred_ by how much the PCA output changes.

* * *

### 🔁 Recap of Risks in Plain PCA

| Risk Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Eigenvector leakage** | Top components reflect dominant (possibly sensitive) structures |
| **Projection leakage** | Transformed coordinates may re-expose dropped attributes |
| **High sensitivity** | Small changes in data → big changes in PCA outcome |
| **Correlation revival** | Even removed features can be indirectly inferred via retained components |

* * *

### 🧠 Why This Motivates Private PCA

We need a **privacy-aware variant** of PCA that:

*   Limits the influence of **individual points** (lowers sensitivity),
*   Prevents **structural leakage** from published components,
*   Still **preserves utility**: we want to retain meaningful axes, just not at privacy’s expense.

📦 Spoiler: The next chapters will present **two such strategies**:

1.  Add Gaussian noise to points ✅
2.  Sample from a smart distribution using the **Exponential Mechanism** ✅✅

* * *

Let me know when you're ready to explore the **first solution: Gaussian Noise**, in **Chapter 3**.

## Response:
Perfect — let’s now unpack **Teachify Chapter 3: Gaussian Noise Mechanism**, which is the first approach toward making PCA _privacy-preserving_. This chapter is all about **simplicity vs. robustness**.

* * *

🔐 Chapter 3: Gaussian Noise Mechanism in Privacy-Preserving PCA
----------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

### 📦 Motivation Recap

From Chapter 2, we saw that:

*   Plain PCA has **high sensitivity**.
*   The output (e.g., eigenvectors) can change a lot if a single individual’s data is modified.

So we need to somehow "blur" the influence of each data point without throwing the entire structure away.

* * *

### 🎯 Strategy 1: Just Add Gaussian Noise

#### 👇 Step-by-Step Idea:

1.  **Start with centered data**:
    $$
    X' = X - \mu_X
    $$
    (Each column: one data point, centered to have mean zero)
2.  **Perturb every row (data point)**:
    $$
    \widetilde{X}_i = X'_i + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)
    $$
    where  $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$  is a multivariate Gaussian noise vector.
3.  **Compute covariance matrix from noisy data**:
    $$
    \widetilde{\Sigma} = \frac{1}{n-1} \widetilde{X} \widetilde{X}^T
    $$
4.  **Do PCA as usual**:
    *   Eigenvectors of  $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ 
    *   Singular value decomposition, etc.

* * *

### 🎉 Why This Is Nice (with Many Data Points)

When  $n$ , the number of points, is **large**:

*   The random noise **averages out**.
*   True correlations in the data dominate.
*   The resulting covariance matrix is _almost_ like the true one — just a little blurry.
*   Privacy is improved because each individual’s contribution is **obscured by the noise**.

#### ✅ Benefits:

| Property | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Simple to implement | ✅ |
| Compatible with any PCA pipeline | ✅ |
| Good privacy guarantees (with math to back it up) | ✅ |
| No need to explicitly track eigenvectors | ✅ |

* * *

### 🧊 Why This Fails With Few Data Points

Now the downside — and it's a serious one.

If your dataset is **small**, let’s say:

*   10 to 100 data points,
*   in a high-dimensional space (e.g., 50 or 100 features),

then:

*   **Each point carries a lot of weight** in the covariance matrix.
*   Gaussian noise **doesn’t average out** — it **distorts** the covariance structure.
*   Resulting eigenvectors can become **nonsense**: not aligned with the true data geometry.

➡️ In practice, your PCA might pick up noise directions as _principal components_.  
That's like aligning your analysis with the noise!

* * *

### 🧠 Analogy: Blurring a Face

Imagine taking a group photo of 1,000 people. If you blur every face slightly, the **overall face distribution** remains recognizable.

Now imagine blurring 3 people in a selfie:  
📸 → 😵‍💫 → you just ruined the entire image.

That’s what happens when you use Gaussian noise in small datasets.

* * *

### 📊 Visual Summary

| Data Size | Result of Noise | PCA Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Many points | Noise averages out | PCA still works |
| Few points | Noise overwhelms signal | PCA fails or misleads |

* * *

### ⚖️ Summary

| 🔍 Aspect | ✅ Gaussian Noise Wins | ❌ Gaussian Noise Fails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Large datasets | ✅ Signal dominates | — |
| Simple mechanism | ✅ Easy to code & understand | — |
| Low sample count | — | ❌ Structure is ruined |
| High-dimensional data | — | ❌ Noise becomes dominant |
| Eigenvector quality | ✅ Good (if enough data) | ❌ Unstable |

* * *

So this leads us to the big question:

> Can we design a smarter mechanism that **targets useful directions** in the data without exposing individuals?

Yes we can — and that’s exactly what the **Exponential Mechanism** does.

Let me know when you’re ready for **Chapter 4** — where we dive into **generalized dot products, score functions, and differential privacy with style** ✨.

## Response:
Here’s how I’d break **Chapter 4** into **three focused sub-chapters**, each tied directly to the concepts and examples in your markdown (`pca-privacy.md`) and lecture transcript (`transcription-pca-privacy.txt`):

* * *

### **Chapter 4.1: Defining the Score Function**

*   **Goal:** Introduce  $u(v)$  as a way to “measure” how well a direction  $v$  aligns with data variance.
*   **Core Content:**
    *   Start from the covariance matrix  $\Sigma = \tfrac1{n-1}X'X'^T$ .
    *   Define the **generalized dot product**
        $$
         u(v)\;=\;v^T\,\Sigma\,v
        $$
        (❖ from transcription: “generalized dot product” slide).
    *   Explain how  $u(v)$  aggregates variance _along_  $v$ , and why this is a natural “utility” score in DP.
*   **Materials Link:**
    *   `pca-privacy.md` pages where  $u(v)$  and its Gaussian-noise–perturbed covariance formula appear.
    *   Transcript snippet showing “dot product” → “generalized dot product” discussion.

* * *

### **Chapter 4.2: Eigenvectors as Score Maximizers**

*   **Goal:** Show that the directions you really want (the PCA axes) are _exactly_ those that maximize  $u(v)$ .
*   **Core Content:**
    *   Recall eigenpair definition:  $\Sigma\,v = \lambda\,v$ .
    *   Plug into the score:
        $$
         u(v) = v^T(\Sigma\,v) = v^T(\lambda\,v) = \lambda\,\|v\|^2 = \lambda
        $$
        (since  $\|v\|=1$ ).
    *   Conclude: **any unit-length eigenvector** yields  $u(v)=\lambda$ , and the **largest eigenvalue** gives the **global maximum** of  $u(v)$ .
*   **Materials Link:**
    *   Transcript explanation: “if  $v$  is an eigenvector, the generalized dot product is just the eigenvalue—and that’s maximal.”
    *   `pca-privacy.md` sections discussing eigenvalues and their role in the score.

* * *

### **Chapter 4.3: Sampling via the Exponential Mechanism**

*   **Goal:** Build and sample from a distribution that _favors_ high-score directions (i.e., eigenvectors), but still offers DP.
*   **Core Content:**
    1.  **Formulate the Exponential Mechanism**:
        $$
         \Pr[v] \propto \exp\!\bigl(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\,\Delta u}\,u(v)\bigr)
        $$
        —where  $\Delta u$  is the sensitivity of  $u$ .
    2.  **Discuss sensitivity** of  $u(v)$  (from Chapter 2).
    3.  **Explain intuition**: high-score (eigenvector) directions get exponentially more weight.
    4.  **Sketch sampling**: rejection sampling on the unit sphere (or Gaussian + renormalize → sphere → accept/reject).
*   **Materials Link:**
    *   Transcript section on “we define a distribution proportional to  $\exp(\text{generalized dot product})$ …”
    *   `pca-privacy.md` flowchart of DP-PCA via the exponential mechanism.

* * *

With these three sub-chapters, we cover: (1) **what** our scoring function is, (2) **why** its maxima are exactly the PCA axes, and (3) **how** to privately sample from it. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks before we proceed with the full teaching!

## Response:
### 🧑‍🏫 **Teachify 4.1 — Defining the Score Function  $u(v)=v^{T}\Sigma v$ **

_(Verbose, professor-style, privacy goggles firmly on 😎🛡️)_

* * *

#### 1️⃣ Setting the Stage — Why We Even Need a Score

Before we can _privately_ pick “good” directions for PCA, we must decide **what makes a direction  $v$  good**.  
Intuitively, a _good_ axis is the one along which the data have **large variance**. In vanilla PCA we identify that by solving an eigen-problem, but in Differential Privacy (DP) we’ll _sample_ directions instead of solving for them exactly. For sampling, we need a **utility score** that says _“this direction is worth more than that one.”_

* * *

#### 2️⃣ Building Blocks — Centered Data & Covariance

*   **Center the data** so each feature has mean 0:
    $$
     X' \;=\; X-\mu_X
    $$
    (This is the same  $X'$  you saw in the PCA recap slides.)
*   **Empirical covariance matrix** (unbiased, denominator  $n-1$ ):
    $$
     \Sigma \;=\; \frac{1}{\,n-1\,} \; X'\,X'^{T}
    $$
     $\Sigma$  captures **all pairwise correlations** and is the algebraic heart of PCA.

> _Privacy view:_  $\Sigma$  is already a global statistic; one person can still nudge it, but we will soon measure _how much_.

* * *

#### 3️⃣ Defining the Generalized Dot Product

In ordinary geometry, the dot product

$$
 \langle a,\,b\rangle \;=\; a^{T}b
$$

tells us “How aligned are vectors  $a$  and  $b$ ?”

We now **generalize** it by inserting the covariance matrix between the two copies of the same vector:

  $$
\boxed{ \;u(v)\;=\;v^{T}\,\Sigma\,v\;}
$$*    $v$  is any **unit vector** ( $\|v\|_2=1$ ) on the unit sphere.
*    $\Sigma$  acts as a _lens_ that stretches the sphere according to data variance.
*   Then we take the dot product of  $v$  with its stretched image  $\Sigma v$ .

You saw exactly this formula on the _“generalized dot product”_ slide in the lecture transcript:  
“ …we define a distribution proportional to  $\exp(\text{generalized dot product})$ … ”

* * *

#### 4️⃣ Why  $u(v)$  Measures Variance Along  $v$ 

1.  **Geometric intuition**
    *    $\Sigma v$  is a linear combination of the dataset’s directions, scaled by covariances.
    *   The dot product  $v^{T}(\Sigma v)$  is literally the **shadow of  $\Sigma v$  onto  $v$ **.
    *   Bigger shadow ⇒ more stretching ⇒ more variance **along**  $v$ .
2.  **Statistical interpretation**
    $$
     u(v)=\operatorname{Var}(v^{T}X)\,
    $$
    because  $v^{T}X$  is the 1-D projection of every data point onto  $v$ .  
    So  $u(v)$  equals the **sample variance in that projection**. (This is buried in the covariance-to-variance derivation snippets of your markdown notes.)

* * *

#### 5️⃣ Why  $u(v)$  Is a Natural DP _Utility_ Function

In differential-privacy land, we need a function that:

*   **Has high values** at points we _want_ (here: true principal directions).
*   **Has bounded sensitivity** — i.e.\\ it doesn’t swing wildly if one person changes her data.

 $u(v)$  fits perfectly:

| Desired Property | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Selects good axes** | Eigenvectors maximize  $u(v)$  (proved in sub-chapter 4.2). |
| **Scalar & differentiable** | Easy to plug into sampling mechanisms. |
| **Sensitivity is analyzable** | Change in one row of  $X'$  perturbs  $\Sigma$  by a rank-1 update, so  $\Delta u$  is bounded. |

Hence the lecture notes choose

$$
 \Pr[v]\;\propto\;\exp\!\bigl(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}\,u(v)\bigr),
$$

which is the **Exponential Mechanism** instantiated with utility  $u(v)$ . (See the “probability proportional to  $e^{u(v)}$ ” description in the transcript.)

* * *

#### 6️⃣ Connecting Back to the Files

*   **Markdown (`pca-privacy.md`)** shows the noisy-covariance formula and the step “score function  $u(v)=v^{T}\Sigma v$ ” in multiple flow-charts and bullet lists.
*   **Transcript (`transcription-pca-privacy.txt`)** narrates the same logic verbally:
    *   introduces  $u(v)$ ,
    *   explains eigenvector optimality,
    *   and motivates the exponential weighting.

* * *

### 📝 Wrap-Up for 4.1

*   We now have a **single scalar function  $u(v)$ ** that quantifies “how much variance lives along  $v$ .”
*   It is **computationally cheap**, **statistically meaningful**, and **privacy-suitable**.
*   In **Sub-chapter 4.2** we’ll prove that _eigenvectors_ are exactly the maximizers of  $u(v)$ .
*   In **Sub-chapter 4.3** we’ll show how the _Exponential Mechanism_ uses  $u(v)$  to _sample_ nearly-optimal axes while guaranteeing  $\varepsilon$ \-differential privacy.

Ready to tackle 4.2?

## Response:
### 🧑‍🏫 **Teachify 4.2 — Eigenvectors as Score Maximizers**

_(Verbose, detail-rich, privacy-aware)_

* * *

#### 1️⃣ Quick Refresher — The Score We’re Maximizing

We previously defined the **generalized dot product** (our DP-utility score) for any unit vector  $v\in\mathbb{R}^d$ :

$$
u(v)\;=\;v^{T}\,\Sigma\,v, \qquad\text{with}\quad \Sigma=\tfrac1{n-1}X'X'^{T}.
$$

So  $u(v)$  equals the **sample variance** when the data are projected onto direction  $v$ .  
Our DP plan is to sample directions with probability  $\propto e^{u(v)}$ .  
Thus we must understand **where  $u(v)$  is largest**. Spoiler: at the _eigenvectors_ of  $\Sigma$ .

* * *

#### 2️⃣ Eigenpairs — The Key Linear-Algebra Fact

An **eigenpair**  $(\lambda,v)$  of  $\Sigma$  satisfies

$$
\Sigma v \;=\;\lambda v.
$$
*    $v\ne 0$  is an **eigenvector** (direction),
*    $\lambda$  is its corresponding **eigenvalue** (how strongly  $\Sigma$  stretches that direction).

Because  $\Sigma$  is **symmetric and positive-semidefinite** (it’s a covariance matrix!), all eigenvalues are **real and non-negative**.

* * *

#### 3️⃣ Plugging an Eigenvector into the Score

Take any **unit-length** eigenvector  $\|v\|_2=1$ . Compute its score:

$$
u(v) =\;v^{T}(\Sigma v) =\;v^{T}(\lambda v) =\;\lambda\,v^{T}v =\;\lambda\,\|v\|_2^{2} =\;\lambda.
$$

Hence the score equals the **eigenvalue itself**.

> **Interpretation:** the larger the eigenvalue, the more variance (spread) lives along that eigenvector, and the larger our utility score.

This is exactly the statement the lecturer made:

> “If  $v$  is an eigenvector, the generalized dot product is just the eigenvalue — and that’s maximal.”

* * *

#### 4️⃣ Proving Optimality — Rayleigh Quotient View

For any **unit vector**  $v$ , the score is the **Rayleigh quotient** of  $\Sigma$ :

$$
u(v)=v^{T}\Sigma v.
$$

Linear-algebra theorems (e.g., Courant–Fischer) say:

$$
\lambda_{\max} = \max_{\|v\|=1} v^{T}\Sigma v,
$$

and the maximizing  $v$  is precisely an eigenvector associated with the **largest eigenvalue**  $\lambda_{\max}$ .

Analogously:

$$
\lambda_{\min} = \min_{\|v\|=1} v^{T}\Sigma v
$$

with eigenvectors of  $\lambda_{\min}$  minimizing the score.

So **all** unit-length eigenvectors are **critical points** of  $u(v)$ , and the **global maximum** is attained at those with the **largest** eigenvalue. This matches the central PCA idea: PC1 = eigenvector with maximal variance.

* * *

#### 5️⃣ Privacy Perspective — Why This Matters

*   **Utility:** By targeting directions with high  $u(v)$ , we ensure the sampled vectors **preserve as much variance as possible** (classical PCA goal).
*   **DP Mechanism:** The **Exponential Mechanism** weights each candidate  $v$  by  $\exp\bigl(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}\,u(v)\bigr)$ . Because  $u(v)$  peaks at top eigenvectors, those directions receive exponentially higher probability while still respecting  $\varepsilon$ \-DP.
*   **Sensitivity Control:** We only need the **difference in  $u(v)$ ** after a single data-point change; for covariance, that change is bounded, giving us a computable  $\Delta u$ . This lets us cap how “spiky” the probabilities can become.

* * *

#### 6️⃣ Anchoring Back to Your Materials

| Source | Connection |
| --- | --- |
| **`transcription-pca-privacy.txt`** | Verbal proof that eigenvectors maximize  $u(v)$  and why that’s useful in DP sampling. |
| **`pca-privacy.md`** | Bullet lists & diagrams showing eigenvalues on the diagonal of  $\Lambda$  and the claim that the largest eigenvalue corresponds to the “best” component. |

* * *

### 📝 Take-Home Messages for 4.2

1.  **Score = Rayleigh Quotient.** For unit vectors,  $u(v)$  equals the Rayleigh quotient of  $\Sigma$ .
2.  **Eigenvectors Optimize It.** Unit eigenvectors give  $u(v)=\lambda$ ; the **largest eigenvalue**  $\lambda_{\max}$  is the **global max**.
3.  **DP Sampling Logic.** Weighting by  $\exp(u(v))$  concentrates probability mass on (nearly) those eigenvectors, achieving high utility while controlling privacy.

With this in hand, we can build a **sampling distribution** that favors “good” axes but bounds disclosure risk. That construction is our focus in **Sub-chapter 4.3**.

### 🧑‍🏫 **Teachify 4.3 — Sampling Principal Directions with the Exponential Mechanism**

_(Long-form walkthrough, connecting math, privacy, and algorithmic practice)_

* * *

1️⃣ Why We Need a _Sampling_ Mechanism Instead of a Deterministic Solver
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A deterministic “take the top eigenvector” routine is **very sensitive**:

*   Swap or tweak one person’s row in  $X'$  →  $\Sigma$  nudges → eigenvectors can pivot a _lot_.
*   High sensitivity ⇒ you’d have to add huge noise to meet DP, destroying utility.

**Solution:** adopt the **Exponential Mechanism (EM)** — a cornerstone of Differential Privacy that _randomizes_ selection in a way that:

1.  Favors outputs with higher “utility” (here: higher variance score  $u(v)$ ).
2.  Bounds how much the output distribution shifts when a single record changes.

You saw the lecturer introduce it in a single sentence:

> “We define a distribution proportional to  $\exp(\text{generalized dot product})$ …”

* * *

2️⃣ Formal Definition of EM for PCA
-----------------------------------

Given our utility score  $u(v) = v^{T}\Sigma v$  (unit  $v$ ), define:

$$
\boxed{ \Pr[v] \;\propto\; \exp\!\Bigl( \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}\; u(v) \Bigr) }
$$

where

*   ** $\varepsilon$ ** = privacy budget you choose,
*   ** $\Delta u$ ** = _global sensitivity_ of  $u$ .

> **Interpretation:** raise _e_ to a scaled version of the utility; larger  $u(v)$  ⇒ exponentially larger weight, but the scale factor  $\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}$  caps how “peaky” the distribution is.

* * *

3️⃣ Computing / Bounding Sensitivity  $\Delta u$ 
-------------------------------------------------

Recall **global sensitivity** (Chapter 2):

$$
\Delta u \;=\; \max_{\text{neighboring }X,X'}\; \max_{\|v\|=1} |\, u_{X}(v) - u_{X'}(v)\,|.
$$
*   **Neighboring datasets** differ in **one data point**.
*   For covariance matrices, replacing a row is a **rank-1 update**, so  $u(v)$  changes by at most
    $$
     \frac{2\,\|x_\text{old}-x_\text{new}\|_{2}}{n-1},
    $$
    (bounded if each row is **L2-clipped** or normalized as in the slides) .
*   In practice we pre-scale every vector so  $\|x_i\|_2\le 1$  (also noted in the “Adding Gaussian Noise” bullet list).  
    Then  $\Delta u$  is a constant  $\tfrac{4}{n-1}$ .

* * *

4️⃣ Intuition Behind the Exponential Weights
--------------------------------------------

|  $u(v)$  Value | Weight  $\propto e^{\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}\,u(v)}$  | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Large** (≈ top eigenvector) | Close to 1 (dominates) | Very likely to be sampled |
| Medium | Noticeably smaller | Occasionally sampled |
| Small (orthogonal to PCs) | ~ 0 | Rarely sampled |

Thus we **bias** the random draw toward high-variance directions while preserving randomness for privacy.

* * *

5️⃣ How to _Actually_ Sample from This Distribution
---------------------------------------------------

The domain is the **unit sphere**  $S^{d-1}$ . Two common pragmatic recipes appear in your materials:

### A. **Rejection Sampling on the Sphere** (flow-chart in `pca-privacy.md`)

1.  **Propose**: pick  $v$  **uniformly at random** on the sphere (easy: draw independent Gaussian vector  $g\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$  then set  $v=g/\|g\|_2$ ).
2.  **Accept** with probability
    $$
     \exp\!\Bigl(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}\,(u(v)-u_\text{max})\Bigr),
    $$
    where  $u_\text{max}$  is an upper bound (e.g., largest eigenvalue).
3.  Repeat until accepted.

> • Works in any dimension, but acceptance can be low if  $d$  is big and  $\varepsilon$  small.  
> • The lecture slides warn about “huge rejection rate → use a tighter proposal” .

### B. **Gaussian-Covariance Trick + Renormalize** (suggested in transcript)

1.  Draw  $g\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ .
    *   This already _tilts_ proposals toward high-variance axes.
2.  Normalize:  $v = g/\|g\|_2$  → now on the sphere.
3.  Optionally do _one_ rejection-sampling step (still DP-safe) to correct residual bias.

> • Much higher acceptance, because proposals are pre-aligned with  $\Sigma$ ’s eigenvectors (the high-score regions).

Both strategies satisfy DP because the **accept/reject rule** only depends on  $u(v)$  and  $\varepsilon$ .

* * *

6️⃣ Privacy & Utility Guarantees
--------------------------------

*   **Privacy:** The EM’s standard proof shows that for any neighboring datasets the output distributions are within an  $\varepsilon$  factor.
*   **Utility:** With probability ≥  $1-\delta$  (tunable), the sampled  $v$  achieves
    $$
     u(v) \;\ge\; \lambda_\text{max} - \frac{2\Delta u}{\varepsilon}\bigl(\log |S^{d-1}|\;+\;\log(1/\delta)\bigr),
    $$
    i.e., we only lose an  $O(\tfrac{\log d}{\varepsilon n})$  chunk of variance compared to true PC1. (High-level statement; the gist is also hinted in the transcript.)

* * *

7️⃣ From One Eigenvector to a Full Basis
----------------------------------------

The algorithm from the slides repeats:

1.  **Sample**  $v_1$  using EM.
2.  **Project** data onto the subspace orthogonal to  $v_1$ .
3.  **Re-compute** a covariance matrix within that sub-space.
4.  **Sample**  $v_2$  there, and so on.

After  $k$  iterations you get  $k$  nearly-orthogonal, almost-principal directions. (See the “project to subspace, choose next vector” diagram in transcript.)

* * *

8️⃣ Summary Cheat-Sheet
-----------------------

| Step | Equation / Action | DP Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Utility** |  $u(v)=v^{T}\Sigma v$  | Encodes variance along  $v$  |
| **Sensitivity** |  $\Delta u = O(\tfrac1{n})$  (after L2-clipping) | Keeps exponent bounded |
| **Distribution** |  $\Pr[v]\propto\exp\!\bigl(\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u}u(v)\bigr)$  | Exponential Mechanism |
| **Sampling** | Gaussian → normalize → accept/reject | Bias toward high utility without deterministic leakage |
| **Guarantees** | DP:  $\varepsilon$  ; Utility: near-optimal  $u(v)$  | Tunable via  $\varepsilon$  |

* * *

### 🚀 Where We Stand

*   **Chapter 4.1**: Defined  $u(v)$ .
*   **Chapter 4.2**: Proved eigenvectors maximize  $u(v)$ .
*   **Chapter 4.3** (just finished): Constructed a **DP sampling algorithm** that strongly favors those eigenvectors while giving formal privacy guarantees.

With this, you now have the full blueprint of **Privacy-Preserving PCA via the Exponential Mechanism**. 🎉

## Prompt:
some follow-up questions:

1) why do we have n-1 instead of n in the denominator in the section below and does it also have anything to do with the fact that you call it unbiased?

2️⃣ Building Blocks — Centered Data & Covariance
• **Center the data** so each feature has mean 0:
    \[
    X' = X - \mu_X
    \]
    (This is the same \( X' \) you saw in the PCA recap slides.)
• **Empirical covariance matrix** (unbiased, denominator \( n-1 \)):
    \[
    \Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} X' {X'}^T
    \]

2) what exactly is epsilon (privacy budget) and how is it picked regarding to this concept, and will picking it follow the same strategy among other privacy related fields in AI?

## Response:
Let's tackle your follow-up questions in detail:

* * *

1) Why do we have  $n-1$  instead of  $n$  in the denominator for the covariance matrix, and does this relate to it being called "unbiased"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short answer:**  
The denominator  $n-1$  is used (instead of  $n$ ) in the empirical covariance formula to ensure the estimate is **unbiased**. This is a foundational statistical principle.

### **Longer explanation:**

*   When we **estimate** the covariance (or variance) from data, we're using the sample mean (which itself is a random variable estimated from the data), not the true population mean.
*   If we divided by  $n$ , the estimate would systematically **underestimate** the true population variance/covariance.
*   Dividing by  $n-1$  corrects for this "degrees of freedom" loss — each time you estimate the mean, you "use up" one degree of freedom, so only  $n-1$  independent deviations remain.
*   This makes the estimator **unbiased**, meaning that, **on average**, it gives you the true population covariance (if you were to repeat the experiment many times with new samples)pca-recap.

This is directly referenced in your lecture materials:

> **Empirical covariance matrix (unbiased, denominator  $n-1$ ):**
> 
> $$
> \Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} X'{X'}^T
> $$
> 
>  $\Sigma$  captures all pairwise correlations and is the algebraic heart of PCA【92:chapter-4-pca-privacy-hard.md】.

**Bottom line:**

*   ** $n-1$ ** in the denominator makes the empirical covariance "unbiased" when estimating from samples.

* * *

2) What is epsilon ( $\varepsilon$ ), the "privacy budget" in DP, and how is it picked? Is it the same strategy for other privacy-related fields?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Short answer:**

*   **Epsilon ( $\varepsilon$ )** quantifies the strength of your privacy guarantee in Differential Privacy (DP).
*   **Smaller  $\varepsilon$  = Stronger privacy, less utility.**
*   **Larger  $\varepsilon$  = Weaker privacy, more utility.**

### **Longer explanation:**

*   In DP, ** $\varepsilon$ ** bounds how much the presence/absence of a single individual can change the output distribution of your algorithm.
*   Think of it as a "privacy dial": **lower** values make it harder for an attacker to infer any individual's presence, but they also force the algorithm to add more noise (hurting utility).
*   **Typical choices** for  $\varepsilon$  in academic work range from  $0.01$  (very strong privacy) to  $10$  (weak, but sometimes necessary for practical utility). Real-world deployments (like in US Census) often use values like 1–2 for strong privacy.

#### **How is it picked?**

*   It's a **design parameter** chosen by data custodians, sometimes negotiated with regulators, domain experts, or via utility/privacy tradeoff analysis.
*   In your PCA context, it's the key scaling factor in the exponential mechanism:
    $$
    \Pr[v] \propto \exp\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta u} u(v)\right)
    $$
    where  $\Delta u$  is the sensitivity of your utility function (how much the score can change if one row changes).

#### **Is it the same for other privacy tasks in AI?**

*   Yes, the **concept** of a privacy budget  $\varepsilon$  is the same across DP mechanisms (whether for counting queries, learning models, clustering, or PCA).
*   The **way** you use  $\varepsilon$  (where the noise is added, or what is randomized) changes between mechanisms, but the core meaning — the maximum allowed difference in output likelihood for any two neighboring datasets — is universal【92:chapter-4-pca-privacy-hard.md】【91:transcription-pca-privacy.txt】.

* * *

**In summary:**

*   ** $n-1$ ** makes the sample covariance/variance unbiased, correcting for estimating the mean from the data itself.
*   **Epsilon ( $\varepsilon$ )** is the universal privacy budget in Differential Privacy; it governs the trade-off between privacy and utility. Picking it is always a practical, often policy-driven choice, but its meaning is consistent across all DP-based privacy techniques.

5️⃣ How to *Actually* Sample from This Distribution

Explain about the part above in two messages. First explain about its first half

## Response:
Absolutely! Let’s focus on **the first half** — **Rejection Sampling on the Sphere** — in depth, as found in your lecture flow-chart and transcript.

* * *

**A. Rejection Sampling on the Unit Sphere**
--------------------------------------------

### **What’s the Goal?**

We want to **sample a direction**  $v$  (a unit vector) from the sphere, such that directions with higher "utility" (variance captured, i.e., high  $u(v)$ ) are exponentially more likely to be picked. But, crucially, we must do this in a way that respects Differential Privacy (DP).

* * *

### **Step 1: Propose a Random Unit Vector**

*   **Uniform proposal:**
    *   Generate a random vector  $g$  from a standard Gaussian:  
         $g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  (where  $I$  is the identity matrix, i.e., each coordinate is a standard normal variable).
    *   Normalize this vector to get a point on the unit sphere:  
         $v = \frac{g}{\|g\|_2}$ .
*   **Result:**  
     $v$  is now a _random direction_ in  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , uniformly distributed over the sphere.

* * *

### **Step 2: Accept/Reject with Exponential Weight**

*   **Score the direction:**
    *   Compute  $u(v) = v^T \Sigma v$  (how much variance along  $v$ ).
*   **Accept with probability:**
    $$
    \text{accept } v \text{ with probability } \exp\left(\frac{\epsilon}{2\Delta u}(u(v) - u_{\max})\right)
    $$
    *    $\epsilon$ : your privacy budget.
    *    $\Delta u$ : the sensitivity of  $u(v)$  (max possible change if one record changes).
    *    $u_{\max}$ : the **maximum possible score** (usually, the largest eigenvalue of  $\Sigma$ ), so the exponent is always  $\leq 0$ , meaning the max probability is 1.

* * *

### **Step 3: Repeat Until Accepted**

*   If your randomly generated  $v$  was "lucky" (i.e., aligned well with high-variance directions), it’s more likely to be accepted.
*   If not, you start again — generate a new  $g$ , normalize, and try again.
*   **High-utility directions are exponentially more likely to be chosen**.

* * *

### **What Are the Practical Caveats?**

*   **Acceptance Rate:**
    *   If the data dimension  $d$  is large or  $\epsilon$  is small (strict privacy), acceptance probability can be **tiny**. This means you might need **lots of proposals** to get one sample!
*   **Lecture notes caution:**
    *   This “naive” rejection sampling can be extremely inefficient (many tries before acceptance) for real-world, high-dimensional problems.

* * *

**Summary so far:**

*   The method is _correct_ and privacy-safe, but can be **inefficient** if not combined with smarter proposal tricks.

* * *

Ready for the next message explaining the **Gaussian-covariance trick and why it’s better for high acceptance?**

## Prompt:
teach the next message

## Response:
Absolutely! Let’s now explain the **second half** — the “**Gaussian-Covariance Trick + Renormalize**” approach, which is a smarter way to do DP-aware sampling on the sphere.

* * *

**B. Gaussian-Covariance Trick + Renormalize**
----------------------------------------------

### **Motivation**

As we saw, uniform rejection sampling can be painfully slow, especially when:

*   The space is high-dimensional (big  $d$ ),
*   Or you demand strong privacy (small  $\epsilon$ ),  
    because “good” directions are rare and most randomly drawn  $v$  get rejected.

**The solution:**

> Instead of proposing vectors _randomly_ everywhere, **propose more often in the directions where high-variance is likely**!

* * *

### **Step 1: Draw from an Aligned Gaussian**

*   **Instead of**  $g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  (which is just the standard Gaussian in all directions),
*   **Draw**  $g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$ ,
    *   Here,  $\Sigma$  is the covariance matrix from your data.
    *   This means the generated vector  $g$  is _already more likely_ to point along the **principal axes** (where the data’s variance is high).

**Why does this help?**  
Because the _high-variance directions_ (the “interesting” ones for PCA and for the exponential mechanism) are now sampled _more frequently_ from the start.

* * *

### **Step 2: Renormalize to the Sphere**

*   Take your proposed  $g$  (which is not unit length),
*   Project it back onto the sphere:
    $$
    v = \frac{g}{\|g\|_2}
    $$
*   Now,  $v$  is again a unit vector, but crucially, you’re much more likely to land in high-utility directions.

* * *

### **Step 3: (Optional) Single-Step Rejection**

*   Because you already “tilted” your proposals toward good directions, the acceptance probability is **much higher**!
*   **Optionally**, you can perform one accept/reject step as before (using the exponential mechanism’s probability formula) to ensure perfect distribution, but you don’t have to: even if you skip this, your samples are already strongly biased toward “good” directions.

* * *

### **Why Is This So Much Better?**

*   **High acceptance rate**: Because the proposal distribution is close to the target, you rarely need to reject.
*   **Same privacy guarantees**: You still use the exponential mechanism’s acceptance probability, so the differential privacy proof holds.
*   **Much faster in high dimensions**: In practice, this method is the one actually used in privacy-preserving PCA implementations.

* * *

### **TL;DR**

*   **Uniform proposal**: simple but slow for high dimensions/strict privacy.
*   **Gaussian-covariance proposal**: smarter, faster, much more practical.
*   Both are DP-correct — just the second is _actually usable_.

* * *

Let me know if you’d like a **concrete example or Python code demo** for one of these sampling tricks!

## Prompt:
Can you show me a simple numerical example on how getting a random vector from a distribution of N(0,Σ) is much more likely to be picked than the other version. Because we do not want to get stuck in lengthy math computations, you are allowed to cut the long computations short by making up results, if needed, but they should also make sense

## Response:
Absolutely! Let’s do a **simple, illustrative numerical example** comparing the two strategies. The goal is to show **why sampling from  $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$ ** makes it much more likely to get a vector aligned with the data's principal direction—so you get accepted quickly in the exponential mechanism.

* * *

**Setup**
---------

Let’s imagine:

*   2D data, already centered.
*   Covariance matrix:
    $$
    \Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    *   The main variance (the first principal component) is **along the x-axis**.

* * *

### **Strategy A: Uniform on the Sphere ( $g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ )**

*   Draw:  
     $g = \begin{pmatrix} z_1 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}$ , where  $z_1, z_2$  are standard normal ( $N(0,1)$ ).
*   Normalize:  
     $v = g/\|g\|$ .
*   With probability theory, **most vectors** point in random directions (not especially aligned with x-axis).
*   The **chance** that a random vector is within 15° of the x-axis is about **8%** (just for illustration).
*   **Score**:  
     $u(v) = v^T \Sigma v = 4v_1^2 + 1v_2^2$ .  
    If  $v$  is “random,” say  $v \approx [0.7, 0.7]$  (45° direction):  
     $u(v) = 4 \times 0.7^2 + 1 \times 0.7^2 = 4 \times 0.49 + 0.49 = 1.96 + 0.49 = 2.45$ .
*   The **maximum possible** score is 4 (when fully aligned with x-axis).
*   So, **most random samples are far from optimal** and will be rarely accepted if  $\epsilon$  is low.

* * *

### **Strategy B: Gaussian-Covariance ( $g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$ )**

*   Draw:  
     $g_1 \sim N(0, 4)$ ,  $g_2 \sim N(0, 1)$ 
*   Typical samples:
    *    $g_1$  will be roughly twice as spread out as  $g_2$ , so values like  $g_1 = 4.0, g_2 = 0.5$  are much more common than the reverse.
*   Normalize:  
     $v = \frac{g}{\|g\|} \approx \frac{[4.0, 0.5]}{\sqrt{4^2 + 0.5^2}} \approx [0.993, 0.124]$ 
*   **Score**:  
     $u(v) = 4 \times (0.993)^2 + 1 \times (0.124)^2 \approx 4 \times 0.986 + 0.015 \approx 3.944 + 0.015 = 3.959$ 
*   **This is almost the max possible!**

* * *

### **Comparison: Acceptance Probability**

For the exponential mechanism:

*   **Acceptance probability** is roughly:  
     $\exp\left( \frac{\epsilon}{2\Delta u} (u(v) - u_{max}) \right)$ 

If  $u_{max} = 4$ :

*   **Random proposal:**  $u(v) \approx 2.45$   
     $u(v) - u_{max} = -1.55$   
    If  $\frac{\epsilon}{2\Delta u} = 1$ , probability =  $e^{-1.55} \approx 0.21$  (**~1 in 5 accepted**)
*   **Gaussian-covariance proposal:**  $u(v) \approx 3.96$   
     $u(v) - u_{max} = -0.04$   
    Probability =  $e^{-0.04} \approx 0.96$  (**almost always accepted!**)

* * *

### **TL;DR Table**

| Proposal | Typical  $v$  | Score  $u(v)$  | Acceptance Probability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uniform on Sphere | \[0.7, 0.7\] | 2.45 | 0.21 |
| Gaussian-Covariance | \[0.99, 0.12\] | 3.96 | 0.96 |

* * *

**Conclusion:**

*   **Uniform proposals** are rarely aligned with the “good” direction, so most are rejected.
*   **Gaussian-covariance proposals** are usually almost perfectly aligned, so almost every sample is accepted!

This is why, in practice, the covariance trick is a _huge_ speedup, especially in high dimensions.

Let me know if you want to see a toy Python snippet for this!

## Prompt:
6 Privacy & Utility Guarantees

- **Privacy:** The EM’s standard proof shows that for any neighboring datasets the output distributions are within an ε factor.

- **Utility:** With probability ≥ 1 − δ (tunable), the sampled v achieves

    u(v) ≥ λ_max − (2Δu/ε) (log|S^d−1| + log(1/δ)),

i.e., we only lose an O((log d)/εn) chunk of variance compared to true PC1. (High-level statement; the gist is also hinted in the transcript.)

Can you expand explanations here at a beginner-friendly level and tell me what relation it has to the previously discussed points?

## Response:
Absolutely, let’s break down **Privacy & Utility Guarantees** for the exponential mechanism in a beginner-friendly way—and then connect it to what we’ve discussed about PCA, sensitivity, and the exponential mechanism.

* * *

**1\. Privacy Guarantee: What Does It Really Mean?**
----------------------------------------------------

*   The **“ε-differential privacy”** guarantee is the central promise of Differential Privacy (DP).
*   **What’s the idea?**
    *   Suppose you have two datasets: one with your data in it, and one without.
    *   **A DP algorithm ensures** that, **no matter what**, the chance of any outcome (e.g., a sampled vector  $v$ ) doesn’t change much if your data is added or removed.
    *   The maximum change in probability is controlled by  $\varepsilon$ .
*   **For the exponential mechanism:**
    *   No matter what direction is chosen, the probability of picking it with/without any single person’s data changes by at most a factor of  $e^{\varepsilon}$  (where  $e \approx 2.718$ ).
    *   This is **the same strong privacy standard** as in all differentially private algorithms—including those for counts, means, machine learning models, etc.

**Connection to earlier points:**

*   Recall: We discussed how “sensitivity” ( $\Delta u$ ) tells us how much a single person’s data can affect the utility function  $u(v)$ .
*   By normalizing for  $\Delta u$  and scaling by  $\varepsilon$ , the exponential mechanism ensures **no single person can have much influence on which vector gets chosen**, thus ensuring privacy【91:transcription-pca-privacy.txt】.

* * *

**2\. Utility Guarantee: How Good Are the Results?**
----------------------------------------------------

*   **The big concern:** If you add too much randomness for privacy, will your result still be useful?
*   **Utility theorem for the exponential mechanism:**
    *   With high probability (at least  $1-\delta$ ), the vector  $v$  you get has a utility score (variance) not much less than the best possible.
    *   Mathematically:
        $$
        u(v) \geq \lambda_{\max} - \frac{2\Delta u}{\varepsilon} \left( \log|S^{d-1}| + \log\frac{1}{\delta} \right)
        $$
        *    $u(v)$ : score of your chosen vector
        *    $\lambda_{\max}$ : maximum possible (the true principal component’s variance)
        *   The rest is the **utility loss** due to privacy

### **Plain English:**

*   The **vector you get by sampling** is **almost as good as the true PCA direction**—you lose just a little bit of variance.
*   The **amount you lose** gets smaller as:
    *   You increase  $\varepsilon$  (allowing a bit less privacy, but getting better accuracy)
    *   You increase  $n$  (more data points; sensitivity drops)
    *   You tolerate a larger  $\delta$  (rare “bad luck” events)

### **How Big Is the Loss?**

*   That “log $|S^{d-1}|$ ” part just means “something that grows slowly as dimension increases”—so in high dimensions, yes, you lose a little more.
*   But typically, for reasonable values of  $\varepsilon$  and enough data, you lose only a small “chunk” of the variance, **not the whole thing**.
*   Formally, the loss is about  $O\left(\frac{\log d}{\varepsilon n}\right)$ , so it shrinks as you add more data or allow a little less privacy.

* * *

**Summary Table**
-----------------

| Guarantee | What It Means | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy | Output can’t reveal much about any single person’s data | Strong protection, even if attacker knows algorithm |
| Utility | Sampled vector is nearly as good as the “true” PCA direction | You still get useful, variance-rich components |

**How Does This Relate to Previous Discussion?**
------------------------------------------------

*   **All pieces connect:**
    *   **Score function  $u(v)$ :** Quantifies how much variance a direction captures.
    *   **Sensitivity  $\Delta u$ :** Measures how much  $u(v)$  can change if one row changes (crucial for DP).
    *   **Exponential mechanism:** Selects directions with probability proportional to their utility, but "smooths" out the influence of any one person, by scaling by  $\varepsilon$  and  $\Delta u$ .
    *   **Guarantee:** You don’t sacrifice too much utility (variance) for the sake of privacy, **as long as you have enough data or can tolerate a little utility loss**.

* * *

**Final thought:**

*   These guarantees mean you get the best of both worlds: **strong privacy** (formally proven) and **useful, high-variance components** for your data analysis—without relying on trusting that no one will try to “reverse engineer” sensitive info from your results.

## Prompt:
7 From One Eigenvector to a Full Basis

The algorithm from the slides repeats:

1. **Sample** v₁ using EM.

2. **Project** data onto the subspace orthogonal to v₁.

3. **Re-compute** a covariance matrix within that sub-space.

4. **Sample** v₂ there, and so on.

After k iterations you get k nearly-orthogonal, almost-principal directions. (See the “project to subspace, choose next vector” diagram in transcript.)

explain this

## Response:
Of course! This step explains **how to get not just one, but multiple principal directions (like in classic PCA), each with privacy**, using the exponential mechanism (EM). Here’s the beginner-friendly walkthrough:

* * *

**Why Isn’t One Vector Enough?**
--------------------------------

*   **Classic PCA** gives you not just the top principal component (PC1), but a whole set of axes: PC1, PC2, PC3, etc.
*   Each axis is **orthogonal** (perpendicular) to the previous ones, and together they span the “important” subspace of your data.
*   In privacy-preserving PCA, we want the same: **a set of nearly-orthogonal, high-utility directions**—but without leaking privacy.

* * *

**Step-by-Step: Building a Private PCA Basis**
----------------------------------------------

### **1\. Sample the First Vector ( $v_1$ ) Using the Exponential Mechanism**

*   Use the exponential mechanism to sample a direction ( $v_1$ ) that captures as much variance as possible (while guaranteeing DP).
*    $v_1$  is _likely_ to be close to the “real” first principal component, but with some randomization for privacy.

* * *

### **2\. Project the Data onto the Subspace Orthogonal to  $v_1$ **

*   “Projecting” means you remove all the information in the direction of  $v_1$ .
*   This is like saying: **let’s look for new patterns in the data that aren’t already captured by  $v_1$ **.

#### _Mathematically:_

*   You subtract the component of each data point in the  $v_1$  direction.
*   What’s left is a new, smaller space (one dimension fewer).

* * *

### **3\. Recompute Covariance in the New Subspace**

*   Now, your data lives in a lower-dimensional space (original dimension minus 1).
*   **Recalculate the covariance matrix**—but _only using the new, projected data_.
*   This new covariance tells you about the variance left **after removing everything  $v_1$  explained**.

* * *

### **4\. Sample the Next Vector ( $v_2$ ) in the New Subspace**

*   Use the exponential mechanism again to sample a new direction,  $v_2$ , that maximizes remaining variance, subject to DP.
*    $v_2$  will be **orthogonal to  $v_1$ **, by construction.

* * *

### **5\. Repeat for More Components**

*   Keep projecting onto the subspace orthogonal to all previously chosen directions, and keep sampling.
*   After  $k$  steps, you have  $k$  nearly-orthogonal, high-utility (but privacy-preserving) principal directions.

* * *

### **Visual Analogy**

Think of it like this:

1.  **Find the strongest pattern** (direction of max variance) with privacy.
2.  **Erase that pattern from the data**.
3.  **Find the next strongest pattern** in what’s left, again with privacy.
4.  **Repeat** until you have as many directions (axes) as you want.

* * *

### **What Do You Get?**

*   A set of  $k$  **almost-principal components** that are _nearly_ orthogonal (because you always remove what previous ones explained).
*   Each one is chosen in a way that keeps **individual data hidden** (thanks to DP).
*   Together, they span a **private, useful subspace** for dimensionality reduction or analysis.

* * *

## Response:
Absolutely! Let’s wrap up with **Chapter 5: Approximating PCA Safely** — pulling together all the ideas and explaining, step-by-step, how and why this privacy-preserving PCA approach works in practice.

* * *

🛡️ Chapter 5: Approximating PCA Safely
---------------------------------------

* * *

### **1\. Projection to Orthogonal Subspaces**

*   In classic PCA, each principal component (PC) you find is **perpendicular** (orthogonal) to the ones before it.
*   In private PCA, after finding each direction with the exponential mechanism (EM), you **remove** everything explained by that direction from your data.
*   This “projection” means you focus only on _new_ patterns the previous PCs didn’t capture.

**Why do this?**

*   So you don’t “double count” variance or allow private information to leak multiple times.
*   It ensures each new component is as informative as possible, _given what’s already been explained_.

* * *

### **2\. Reconstructing Orthonormal Bases**

*   The set of principal directions you build — one at a time, always removing the previous direction — eventually gives you a **basis** for your data space.
*   **Orthonormal** just means:
    *   Every direction is at a right angle (orthogonal) to all others.
    *   Each direction has length 1 (normalized).

**How does this help?**

*   Orthonormal bases are mathematically “clean”: you can easily transform data into this new space and back again.
*   They make analysis, dimensionality reduction, and downstream machine learning tasks much easier and more interpretable.

* * *

### **3\. Utility vs. Privacy Trade-Offs**

*   **Utility** is how well your new axes (directions) capture the real patterns and spread (variance) in the data.
*   **Privacy** is how much you “blur” your output to protect any one individual’s data.

**Trade-off explained:**

*   **Stronger privacy** (smaller ε): you add more randomness, so the new directions may be less perfectly aligned with the actual main trends in the data — you lose a little more variance.
*   **Weaker privacy** (bigger ε): your results look more like classic PCA (high utility), but you leak more information about individuals.

**Key insight:**  
With **enough data** and a **carefully chosen ε**, you can get a basis that’s both **useful and privacy-protecting**. The math shows you don’t lose much variance — just a small “chunk” compared to classic PCA.

* * *

### **4\. Wrap-Up: Why Is This Approach Clever, Powerful, and Privacy-Preserving?**

**Clever:**

*   Instead of blindly adding noise everywhere, you _target_ the directions that matter for your data.
*   You sample directions with smart randomness, so your results are still meaningful.

**Powerful:**

*   You get a whole basis (set of axes) that can be used for real-world tasks: data visualization, compression, machine learning, etc.
*   Your analysis is robust and mathematically principled.

**Privacy-Preserving:**

*   No single person’s data can swing the result too much.
*   Even if an attacker knows your method and the output, they **cannot infer** much about any individual in your dataset.

**Big picture:**

*   **Private PCA** is a great example of _modern trustworthy AI_: you get valuable insights from your data _without_ exposing anyone’s secrets.
*   It’s a **template** for other privacy-preserving machine learning methods—clever use of randomness, sensitivity bounds, and math to balance utility and privacy.

* * *

### **Take-home Message**

> You can analyze high-dimensional, sensitive data with _almost all the power of classical PCA_, but with _formal, provable privacy guarantees_—thanks to the clever use of exponential mechanism, projections, and careful basis construction.
